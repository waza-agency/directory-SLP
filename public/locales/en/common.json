      "originText": "The park was formed on the grounds of the old Hacienda de la Tenería, which dates back to 1609. The hacienda's main building is still preserved within the park, serving as a silent witness to over four centuries of Potosino history.",

The park was officially inaugurated in 1983 during the government of Prof. Carlos Jonguitud Barrios. In 1997, the government gave it the official name \"Parque Carlos Jonguitud Barrios\", although most people simply know it as Tangamanga Park.",

Its more than 1.8 million trees make it the most important green lung of San Luis Potosí, producing 800 tons of oxygen per year."
