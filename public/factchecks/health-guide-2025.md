- Dermatology: $600-1,200 MXN (reasonable for specialists)
- Ophthalmology: $500-1,000 MXN (reasonable)
- Pediatrics: $500-900 MXN (reasonable)
- Gynecology: $600-1,200 MXN (reasonable)

These ranges appear reasonable based on general Mexican healthcare pricing, but SLP-specific verification was not possible.

**CONFIDENCE:** Medium - Reasonable estimates, no SLP-specific verification

### CLAIM 20: Hospital Ratings

**CLAIM:** Various hospital ratings (4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 stars)

**VERDICT:** ❓ UNVERIFIABLE

**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
No verified source found for the specific star ratings assigned to hospitals in the guide.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
The guide lists specific star ratings (4.8 for Hospital Lomas, 4.7 for Hospital Angeles, 4.6 for Star Médica, 4.5 for Christus Muguerza), but no source is provided and web searches did not reveal any authoritative rating system for these hospitals.

Potential sources (Google Reviews, healthcare rating sites) were not found during the investigation. Without verification, these ratings should be removed or marked as estimates/user reviews.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Remove specific ratings or add disclaimer "Based on patient reviews (not independently verified)"

**CONFIDENCE:** N/A - Unverifiable

---

### CLAIM 21: Emergency Room Wait Times

**CLAIM:** Various ER wait times listed (15-30 min, 20-40 min, etc.)

**VERDICT:** ❓ UNVERIFIABLE

**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
No authoritative source found for emergency room wait time statistics at San Luis Potosí hospitals.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
The guide provides specific ER wait estimates:
- Hospital Lomas: 15-30 min
- Hospital Angeles: 20-40 min
- Star Médica: 20-35 min
- Christus Muguerza: 25-45 min

Emergency room wait times vary significantly by time of day, severity of condition (triage), and facility capacity. Without official hospital statistics or verified patient data, these estimates cannot be confirmed.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Remove specific wait times or add disclaimer "Wait times vary by severity and time of day"

**CONFIDENCE:** N/A - Unverifiable

---

### CLAIM 22: Specific Clinic Names and Ratings

**CLAIM:** Various specific clinics listed with ratings (Clínica Médica del Centro ★4.5, Dental Spa SLP ★4.8, etc.)

**VERDICT:** ❓ UNVERIFIABLE

**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
Individual clinic verification would require extensive investigation beyond the scope of this fact-check.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
The guide lists numerous specific clinics with star ratings and phone numbers. Verifying each individual clinic's:
- Existence
- Exact phone number
- Star rating
- Services offered

...would require 30+ individual searches. Without systematic verification, these listings should be treated as directory information requiring user verification.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add disclaimer "Clinic information provided for reference - please verify current contact details and services"

**CONFIDENCE:** N/A - Not systematically verified

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Accuracy Patterns
The article demonstrates mixed accuracy:
- **Major claims (healthcare costs, emergency numbers, major hospitals):** Highly accurate
- **Specific contact details (phone numbers, addresses):** Multiple errors requiring correction
- **Pricing information:** Generally accurate but some outdated figures
- **Ratings and subjective assessments:** Unverifiable

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Outdated contact information:** Multiple hospital phone numbers incorrect
2. **Emergency number error:** Cruz Roja number wrong (high priority fix)
3. **Pharmacy consultation pricing:** Farmacias del Ahorro is FREE, not $40-60 MXN
4. **Farmacias Similares pricing outdated:** Should be 70-85 pesos, not 35-40 pesos
5. **Unverified ratings:** No source for star ratings and wait times
6. **Facility mischaracterization:** Christus Muguerza is ambulatory center, not full hospital

### Bias Indicators
**Positive bias toward private healthcare:**
- Focus on premium private hospitals
- Limited information about public healthcare quality
- No mention of public healthcare wait time advantages

**Overall:** Article provides valuable information but needs corrections to contact details and pricing.

### Sourcing Quality
The original article lacks citation of specific sources. Our investigation relied on:
- Official hospital websites and government portals
- International health insurance providers
- Cost-of-living databases (Numbeo)
- Healthcare comparison sites
- Mexican government health resources
