**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
Verified comparisons show San Luis Potosí is 59-78% cheaper than major US cities, confirming the 60-70% claim.

### CLAIM 3: Housing - Lomas Neighborhood

**CLAIM:** "Lomas 1-bedroom: $300-450/month, 2-bedroom: $450-650/month, 3-bedroom house: $700-1,000/month"

**VERDICT:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE

**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
Limited specific data for Lomas neighborhood, but general SLP rental data and specific Lomas del Tecnológico listing support the range.

**EVIDENCE CHAIN:**
- **Primary Source:** [Properstar Lomas del Tecnológico](https://www.properstar.com/mexico/san-luis-potosi-l1/rent) - 3BR apartment $941
- **Corroborating Source 1:** [Nomads.com](https://nomads.com/cost-of-living/in/san-luis-potosi) - Average monthly rent $349
- **Corroborating Source 2:** [Mexico Relocation Guide](https://mexicorelocationguide.com/life-in-san-luis-potosi-mexico/) - Rentals $500-$1,000 monthly

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
A specific listing in Lomas del Tecnológico shows a 3-bedroom at $941, which falls within the claimed $700-1,000 range. However, limited data exists for 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom specific pricing in Lomas. General SLP rental averages ($349-$500) suggest the claimed ranges are reasonable but cannot be fully verified for this specific neighborhood.

**CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS:**
Neighborhood-specific pricing varies significantly. "Lomas" encompasses multiple colonias (Lomas del Tecnológico, Lomas 1a-4a Sección) which may have different price points.

**CONFIDENCE:** Medium - Limited neighborhood-specific data

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
A specific 2-bedroom apartment in Col. Polanco is listed at $914-$1,021, which is 7-20% above the claimed $600-850 range. This suggests the upper-end pricing may be conservative. However, only one data point exists, limiting verification.

**CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS:**
Polanco is an upscale neighborhood, and individual listings may vary based on amenities, building quality, and exact location within the colonia.

**CONFIDENCE:** Low - Single data point available

---

### CLAIM 5: Housing - Centro Histórico

**CLAIM:** "Centro Histórico Studio: $250-350/month, 1-bedroom: $300-450/month, 2-bedroom colonial: $500-800/month"

**INVESTIGATION SUMMARY:**
No specific rental data found for Centro Histórico properties during investigation.

**DETAILED ANALYSIS:**
While general SLP rental averages ($349 average per Nomads.com) suggest these prices are plausible for older colonial properties in the historic center, no specific listings or data for Centro Histórico were found to verify the claim.

**CONFIDENCE:** Low - No specific data available

---

### CLAIM 6: Monthly Groceries
