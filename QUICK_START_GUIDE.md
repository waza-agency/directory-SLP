**Full detailed analysis:** See `EXPAT_SEO_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`

---

## CRITICAL ACTIONS (Do This Week!)

### ✅ Action 1: Create First Blog Post (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why:** You have ZERO published blog posts despite having complete infrastructure. This is blocking all organic traffic.

**What to Do:**
1. Create file: `/src/pages/blog/living-in-san-luis-potosi-expat-guide.tsx`
2. Write 3,500-word comprehensive guide covering:
   - Why expats choose SLP
   - Cost of living breakdown ($800-1,500/mo)
   - Best neighborhoods (Lomas, Zona Universitaria)
   - Healthcare (English-speaking doctors)
   - Visa requirements
   - Safety guide
   - Community resources

**SEO Elements to Include:**
```typescript
<SEO
  title="Complete Guide to Living in San Luis Potosí as an Expat (2025) - Cost, Visa, Housing"
  description="Everything expats need to know about living in San Luis Potosí, Mexico: cost of living ($800-1,500/mo), best neighborhoods, visa requirements, healthcare, safety & community."
  keywords="living in san luis potosi, san luis potosi expat guide, cost of living slp, expat mexico"
/>

// Add FAQ Schema for featured snippets
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How much does it cost to live in San Luis Potosí?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A comfortable expat lifestyle costs $800-1,500 per month including rent, food, utilities, and entertainment. This is 60-70% cheaper than living in the United States."
      }
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

**Target Keyword:** "living in san luis potosi" (720 searches/month)

**Template:** See full blog post outline in main report, section "Blog Post 1"

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours (or hire writer for $150-200)

---

### ✅ Action 2: Update Sitemap.xml

**Why:** Current sitemap shows lastmod dates from April 2023 (2+ years old!). Google sees this as stale.

**What to Do:**
```bash
# Run sitemap generation
npm run generate-sitemap
```

**Manual Update Required:**

File: `/sitemap.xml`

Change ALL dates from `2023-04-25` to `2025-10-21`

Add blog section:
```xml
<!-- Blog Pages -->
<url>
  <loc>https://www.sanluisway.com/blog</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-10-21</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.9</priority>
</url>
```

**Submit to Google:**
1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Sitemaps → Add sitemap URL
3. Submit: https://www.sanluisway.com/sitemap.xml

**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

---

### ✅ Action 3: Optimize Homepage for Expat Keywords

**File:** `/src/pages/index.tsx`

**Changes to Make:**

**1. Update Title Tag:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<title>San Luis Potosí - Your Insider Guide</title>

// AFTER:
<title>San Luis Potosí Guide for Expats - Living, Housing & Community | San Luis Way</title>
```

**2. Update Meta Description:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<meta name="description" content="Discover San Luis Potosí with San Luis Way..." />

// AFTER:
<meta name="description" content="Moving to San Luis Potosí? Your complete expat guide: cost of living ($800-1,500/mo), safe neighborhoods, English-speaking doctors, visa help & expat community. Start your Mexican adventure!" />
```

**3. Add Expat Section (after hero carousel):**

See full code in main report, section 2.1 "Optimize Homepage"

Key elements:
- "Moving to San Luis Potosí?" heading
- 3-column grid: Cost of Living | Visa Guide | Best Neighborhoods
- Email capture: "Free Download: Moving to SLP Checklist"

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour

---

### ✅ Action 4: Optimize /expat-guide Page

**File:** `/src/pages/expat-guide.tsx`

**Changes to Make:**

**1. Update Page Title:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<title>Expat Guide | San Luis Way</title>

// AFTER:
<title>San Luis Potosí Expat Guide: Living, Healthcare & Community (2025)</title>
```

**2. Update H1:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
<h1>Expat Guide to San Luis Potosí</h1>

// AFTER:
<h1>San Luis Potosí Expat Guide: Living, Healthcare & Community (2025)</h1>
<p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mt-4">
  Everything foreigners need to know about moving to and thriving in SLP, Mexico
</p>
```

**3. Add FAQ Schema:**

Add to `<Head>` section:
```typescript
<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: JSON.stringify({
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": [
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "How much does it cost to live in San Luis Potosí as an expat?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Most expats live comfortably in San Luis Potosí for $800-1,500 per month, including rent, food, utilities, and entertainment."
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Question",
        "name": "Are there English-speaking doctors in San Luis Potosí?",
        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, several hospitals in San Luis Potosí have English-speaking doctors: Hospital Lomas de San Luis, Hospital Angeles, and Hospital Central. Private visits cost $30-70 USD."
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}}/>
```

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

---

### ✅ Action 5: Add Hreflang Tags for International SEO

```typescript
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Head>
        {/* Hreflang tags for international SEO */}
        <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="en" href="https://www.sanluisway.com" />
        <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="es" href="https://www.sanluisway.com?lang=es" />
        <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="en-US" href="https://www.sanluisway.com" />

      </Head>
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />

    </Html>
  );
}
```
