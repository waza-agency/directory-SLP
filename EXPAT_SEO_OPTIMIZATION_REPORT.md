### 1.2 Update Sitemap.xml

**Current Issue:** Last modified dates show April 2023 (2+ years old)

**File:** `/sitemap.xml`

**Action:** Regenerate sitemap with current dates and include blog URLs.

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Run the sitemap generation script
npm run generate-sitemap
```

**What Should Be Added:**
```xml
<!-- Blog Pages (NEW) -->
<url>
  <loc>https://www.sanluisway.com/blog</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-10-21</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.9</priority>
</url>

<!-- Individual Blog Posts (Generate dynamically) -->
<url>
  <loc>https://www.sanluisway.com/blog/living-in-san-luis-potosi-expat-guide</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-10-21</lastmod>
  <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.8</priority>
</url>

<!-- Update Existing Pages with Current Dates -->
<url>
  <loc>https://www.sanluisway.com/</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-10-21</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>1.0</priority>
</url>

<url>
  <loc>https://www.sanluisway.com/expat-guide</loc>
  <lastmod>2025-10-21</lastmod>
  <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
  <priority>0.9</priority>
</url>
```

**Script Update Required:**

File: `/scripts/generate-sitemap.js`

Ensure it:
1. Pulls blog posts from Supabase
2. Uses current date for lastmod
3. Sets appropriate priorities (homepage=1.0, blog=0.9, posts=0.8)

---

### 1.3 Add Hreflang Tags for International SEO

**Issue:** No hreflang tags despite having English/Spanish content capability.

**Impact:** Google doesn't know which language version to show to which audience.

**Implementation:**

**File:** `/src/pages/_document.tsx`

Add hreflang tags:

```typescript
// _document.tsx
import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript, DocumentContext } from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx: DocumentContext) {
    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx);
    return { ...initialProps };
  }

  render() {
    const currentUrl = `https://www.sanluisway.com${this.props.__NEXT_DATA__.page}`;

    return (
      <Html lang="en">
        <Head>
          {/* Hreflang tags for international SEO */}
          <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="en" href={currentUrl} />
          <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="es" href={`${currentUrl}?lang=es`} />
          <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="en-US" href={currentUrl} />
          <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="es-MX" href={`${currentUrl}?lang=es`} />
          <link rel="alternate" hrefLang="x-default" href={currentUrl} />

          {/* Existing head content */}
        </Head>
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

  <script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: JSON.stringify({
      "@context": "https://schema.org",

        }
      ]

**Enhance Content Sections with Keywords:**

    Keep these essential emergency numbers saved. English-speaking assistance
    available at tourist police and private hospitals.

    Finding quality healthcare in SLP is easy, with several hospitals offering
    English-speaking doctors and international insurance acceptance. Costs are
    60-80% cheaper than the US while maintaining high standards.
  </p>

  <h3>Best Hospitals for Expats</h3>

  <p className="font-bold text-lg mb-2">
    📣 Living in SLP? Share Your Experience!
  </p>
  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
    Help future expats by sharing your cost of living, favorite neighborhoods, or tips.
  </p>

## PRIORITY 4: TECHNICAL SEO (Weeks 4-6)

### 4.1 Page Speed Optimization

**Current:** Good (per analysis), but can improve further for mobile.

**Actions:**
1. **Enable Next.js Image Optimization** (already done ✓)
2. **Lazy Load Below-Fold Images:**
```tsx
<Image
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  loading="lazy"
  priority={false}
/>
```

3. **Reduce JavaScript Bundle Size:**
   - Run: `npx @next/bundle-analyzer`
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Code-split large libraries

4. **Optimize Fonts:**
```tsx
// _document.tsx
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="/fonts/inter.woff2"
  as="font"
  type="font/woff2"
  crossOrigin="anonymous"
/>
```

5. **Enable Compression:**
   Already configured in `next.config.js` ✓

### 4.2 Mobile Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Touch targets minimum 48x48px
- [ ] Font size minimum 16px (avoid zoom on input focus)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Fast mobile load time (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Sticky header doesn't cover content
- [ ] Forms mobile-friendly (large inputs, clear labels)

**Test Tools:**
- Google Mobile-Friendly Test
- PageSpeed Insights (mobile)
- Chrome DevTools mobile emulation

### 4.3 Core Web Vitals Optimization

**Target Scores:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): <2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): <100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): <0.1

**Current Status:** Check with:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# Test with Lighthouse
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Set explicit width/height on images (prevent CLS)
- Preload critical assets (improve LCP)
- Minimize third-party scripts (improve FID)

### 4.4 Structured Data Expansion

**Add Missing Schema Types:**

**1. LocalBusiness Schema (for Homepage)**

```tsx
// Homepage
<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: JSON.stringify({
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "LocalBusiness",
    "name": "San Luis Way",
    "description": "Complete guide to San Luis Potosí for expats and travelers",
    "url": "https://www.sanluisway.com",
    "telephone": "+52-444-XXX-XXXX", // If applicable
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "addressLocality": "San Luis Potosí",
      "addressRegion": "SLP",
      "addressCountry": "MX"
    },
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
      "latitude": 22.1565,
      "longitude": -100.9855
    },
    "areaServed": {
      "@type": "City",
      "name": "San Luis Potosí"
    },
    "sameAs": [
      "https://www.facebook.com/sanluisway",
      "https://www.instagram.com/sanluisway",
      "https://twitter.com/sanluisway"
    ]
  })
}}/>
```

**2. BreadcrumbList Schema (All Pages)**

Already implemented in blog posts ✓ - Add to other pages.

**3. HowTo Schema (for Guide Pages)**

```tsx
// Visa Guide Page
<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: JSON.stringify({
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "HowTo",
    "name": "How to Get a Temporary Resident Visa for Mexico",
    "description": "Step-by-step guide to obtaining temporary residency in Mexico for living in San Luis Potosí",
    "step": [
      {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Determine Visa Type",
        "text": "Decide between tourist visa (FMM), temporary resident visa (1-4 years), or permanent resident visa.",
        "url": "https://www.sanluisway.com/blog/mexico-visa-guide-slp#step-1"
      },
      {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Gather Required Documents",
        "text": "Collect passport, bank statements showing $2,000+/month income or $40,000+ savings, application form, and passport photos.",
        "url": "https://www.sanluisway.com/blog/mexico-visa-guide-slp#step-2"
      },
      // ... more steps
    ]
  })
}}/>
```

**4. Review Schema (for Category Pages with Listings)**

```tsx
// English-Speaking Healthcare Category
{listings.map(listing => (
  <script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: JSON.stringify({
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Review",
      "itemReviewed": {
        "@type": "MedicalBusiness",
        "name": listing.name,
        "address": listing.address
      },
      "author": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "San Luis Way"
      },
      "reviewRating": {
        "@type": "Rating",
        "ratingValue": listing.rating || "4.5",
        "bestRating": "5"
      },
      "reviewBody": listing.description
    })
  }}/>
))}
```

### 4.5 Fix Missing Alt Text on Images

**Scan for Images Without Alt Text:**

```bash
# Find images missing alt text
grep -r "<img" src/ | grep -v "alt="
grep -r "<Image" src/ | grep -v "alt="
```

**Alt Text Best Practices:**

```tsx
// BAD:
<Image src="/hero.jpg" alt="image" />

// GOOD:
<Image
  src="/hero.jpg"
  alt="Aerial view of San Luis Potosí historic center with Cathedral and Armas Plaza"
/>

// BAD:
<Image src="/doctor.jpg" alt="doctor" />

// GOOD:
<Image
  src="/doctor.jpg"
  alt="English-speaking doctor at Hospital Lomas examining patient in San Luis Potosí"
/>
```

**Rules:**
- Be descriptive (8-15 words ideal)
- Include target keyword when relevant (don't force)
- Describe what's in the image, not just the topic
- Avoid "image of" or "picture of" (redundant)

---

## PRIORITY 5: OFF-PAGE SEO & MARKETING (Ongoing)

I'd like to contribute a unique guest post for your readers:

The article would cover:

I'll include original data from our expat surveys and exclusive photos.

## RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Low Traffic Initially**
- **Solution:** Focus on conversion rate optimization. Even 500 visitors/mo can convert if content is excellent.
- **Metric:** Aim for 5%+ email signup rate

**Challenge 2: Competing with Established Sites**
- **Solution:** Go ultra-specific. "SLP for expats" is less competitive than "Mexico for expats."
- **Strategy:** Own the niche, then expand

**Challenge 3: Content Creation Burnout**
- **Solution:** Batch content creation. Write 3 posts in one week, schedule over 3 weeks.
- **Alternative:** Hire freelance writer familiar with expat life

**Challenge 4: Algorithm Changes**
- **Solution:** Diversify traffic sources (organic, social, email, referral).
- **Target:** No single source should be >50% of traffic

**Challenge 5: Keeping Content Updated**
- **Solution:** Set quarterly content refresh schedule.
- **Process:** Update prices, add new info, refresh publish dates
