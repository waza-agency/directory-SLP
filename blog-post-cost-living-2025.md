## Frequently Asked Questions

**Safety tips:**
- Stick to well-lit, populated areas at night
- Use authorized taxis/Ubers
- Don't flash expensive jewelry/electronics
- Learn basic Spanish for emergencies

### Can I live on Social Security alone?

### Do I need to speak Spanish?

**Short term:** No. Many services have English speakers, especially in healthcare and expat-friendly areas.

**Long term:** Yes. You'll integrate better, access cheaper local services, make friends, and handle emergencies. Spanish classes cost $8-15/hour for private tutors.

### What about taxes?

**Mexican tax residents (183+ days/year):** File Mexican taxes on worldwide income. Tax rates: 0-35% (similar to US).

- **10-15% cheaper than:** Querétaro, Guanajuato
