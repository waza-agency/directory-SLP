## 6. Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- **Conversational:** Write like you're updating a friend, not writing a news report
- **Helpful:** Always think "how does this help the reader?"
- **Inclusive:** Remember readers range from new arrivals to long-term residents
- **Balanced:** Mix serious news with fun discoveries
- **Local but accessible:** Use Spanish terms but explain them

### Writing Rules

**DO:**
- Use **active voice** and present tense
- Keep sentences **short** (15-20 words max)
- Include **specific details** (dates, addresses, prices)
- Use **bullet points** for scanning
- Add **emojis** to mark sections (not overuse)
- Explain **Spanish terms** briefly
- Include **"why it matters"** for news items
- Write for **5th-grade reading level**

**DON'T:**
- Write walls of text
- Assume local knowledge
- Be alarmist about safety/crime
- Overload with too many items
- Forget links to sanluisway.com
- Use complex jargon
- Be overly promotional

### News Summary Formula

```
**[Clear Headline in English]**
[What happened + when + where in 1-2 sentences]
→ Why it matters: [How this affects readers' daily life in 1 sentence]
```

### Event Summary Formula

```
[EMOJI] [EVENT NAME]
📅 [Day], [Date] | [Time]
📍 [Venue], [Address]
[What it is + Why attend + What's special in 2-3 sentences]
💰 [Cost or "Free"] | 🔗 [Link]
```
