## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Risk 1: High CPC in Competitive Keywords

**Mitigation:**
- Start with long-tail, low-competition keywords
- Focus on geo-targeted terms (city-specific)
- Use phrase/exact match to avoid broad traffic
- Monitor Quality Score closely (aim for 7+)

**Contingency:**
- If CPC >$2.00 for low-value traffic, pause keyword
- Shift budget to better-performing campaigns
- Focus on SEO for high-CPC keywords instead

---

### Risk 2: Low Conversion Rate from Ads

**Mitigation:**
- Optimize landing pages BEFORE scaling budget
- Clear, compelling CTAs on every page

- Use remarketing aggressively

**Contingency:**
- If conversion rate <2% after Month 1, pause campaigns
- Conduct user testing on landing pages
- Revise value proposition and messaging
- Consider offering lead magnet (free guide) to lower barrier

---

### Risk 3: Insufficient Business Subscription Signups

**Mitigation:**
- Offer 3-month free trial to first 20 businesses

---

### Risk 4: Market Too Small (Not Enough Search Volume)

**Mitigation:**
- Expand targeting to all of Mexico (broader "expat Mexico" terms)
- Target "considering moving to Mexico" earlier in funnel
- Create content to rank organically for low-volume keywords
- Expand to Display Network and YouTube for awareness

**Contingency:**
- If traffic <1,500 clicks/month after optimization, reduce budget
