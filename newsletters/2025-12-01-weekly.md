## 💡 EXPAT PRO TIP

**Christmas in SLP runs until January 6th!** Unlike in the US or Europe, Mexican Christmas celebrations peak on December 24 (Nochebuena), continue through New Year's, and culminate on January 6 (Día de Reyes/Three Kings Day). Many businesses close December 24-25 and January 1, so stock up on essentials. The best part? You'll see the decorations and lights all month long!
